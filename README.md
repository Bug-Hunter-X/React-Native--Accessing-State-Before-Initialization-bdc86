# React Native: Accessing State Before Initialization

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: attempting to access state variables before they've been initialized.  Asynchronous operations often cause this, making the application display undefined or null values where the state should be. The solution utilizes the useEffect hook to ensure the state is correctly accessed only after initialization.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`.
4. Observe the initial render, it shows an error.
5. After the state gets initialized, the application works correctly.

## Solution

The solution utilizes the useEffect hook. This hook allows us to perform side-effects such as fetching data or accessing state after the component has mounted, guaranteeing that the state has had time to initialize.
